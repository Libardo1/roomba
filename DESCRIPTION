Title: Tidy up nested list hairballs
Authors@R: c(
    person("Jim", "Hester", email = "james.f.hester@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre")),
    person("Amanda", "Dobbyn", role = "aut"),

Version: 0.1.0
Description: This is a package to transform large, multi-nested lists into a more
  user-friendly format. The initial focus is on making
  processing of return values from `jsonlite::fromJSON()` queries more seamless,
  but ideally this package should be useful for deeply-nested lists from an array
  of sources.
